# 👋 Hey there, I’m Marc Alvin Vistan Teano

I’m a late-career pivoter and lifelong tech enthusiast rebuilding my professional presence in IT, with a sharp focus on **infrastructure, servers, and data center operations**. My journey didn’t start in a lab or a textbook—it started in a dark cinema, heart pounding, watching *Hackers*, *The Matrix*, *Sneakers*, *Ghost in the Shell*, and *WarGames*. Those stories planted the seed. Now I’m living the grind that brings them to life—rack by rack, config by config.

That spark became a fire. That fire became discipline.  
Now it’s my mission.

## 🧪 Homelab: Dell PowerEdge T430

Currently building and operating an enterprise-grade lab environment to simulate real-world infrastructure and data center operations. This lab is used for deploying, testing, and maintaining servers and services across a virtual and physical hybrid stack.

### Key Objectives

- Full server deployment and OS installation (Ubuntu Server, Proxmox VE)
- RAID array configuration (HDD and SSD — RAID 1/5)
- BIOS/iDRAC setup, flashing ISOs, and SHA256 verification
- pfSense firewall setup and VLAN segmentation
- Physical drive swaps, cable management, airflow planning
- Remote access testing with SSH, RDP, and console management
- Performance monitoring and logging with lightweight tools

📄 **Build Log:**  
➡️ [T430 Airgapped Proxmox Build – ZFS RAID1 Deployment](docs/t430-airgapped-homelab.md)

🛠️ **Status:** Operational — hypervisor installed, ZFS mirrored, ISO vault stocked, and offline `.deb` package bank loaded. VM provisioning and GUI layering next.
