# 👋 Hi there, I'm Marc Alvin Vistan Teano

🎯 **Returning Technologist with a Focus on IT Support and Cybersecurity**

I’m a computer science graduate with a passion for cybersecurity, now actively pursuing roles in IT support and cloud security after a dedicated return to the tech field. After earning my degree in Computer Science in Manila, I migrated to Sydney before launching my tech career. During the transition, I worked in customer-facing roles — including hospitality and healthcare operations — which sharpened my communication, coordination, and problem-solving skills. Now, I’m fully re-engaged in IT, combining my technical foundation with modern certifications and hands-on cybersecurity training.

I’m currently pursuing entry-level roles in **IT Support, Cloud Operations, and Cybersecurity**, leveraging a strong foundation in computer science, practical certifications, and immersive hands-on training through SOC simulations and virtual labs.
