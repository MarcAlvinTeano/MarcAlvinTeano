# Marc Alvin Vistan Teano

Linux-first infrastructure technician pivoting into enterprise IT and data center operations. My mission is to deliver reliable, secure, and well-documented systems—rack by rack, config by config. I come from a high-pressure healthcare ops background where discipline and uptime were non-negotiable. Now I'm applying that same operational intensity to servers, networks, and hybrid lab deployments.

## 🛠️ Current Lab: Foxglove Forge

Built on a Dell PowerEdge T430, air-gapped and virtualized via Proxmox VE. Designed to simulate real-world enterprise environments for hands-on training and system validation.

**Phase 1 – Core Services (✅ Completed)**  
- Proxmox VE installed with ZFS (RAID1)  
- Ubuntu Server with bind9 DNS, SSH, and rsyslog configuration  
- Xubuntu GUI node for internal management

**Phase 2 – Attack Simulation (🔄 In Progress)**  
- Kali Linux deployed for red team tooling and penetration testing

**Phase 3 – Detection & Perimeter (🔜 Scheduled)**  
- Security Onion 2.4: Zeek, Suricata, alert triage simulation  
- OPNsense firewall/router for VLAN segmentation and DMZ setup

📄 **Build Log**: [T430 Airgapped Homelab – Phase 1 Deployment](https://github.com/MarcAlvinTeano/MarcAlvinTeano/blob/main/docs/t430-airgapped-homelab.md)

> Focus Areas: hardware setup, BIOS/iDRAC, ISO validation, syslog forwarding, service hardening, log correlation, detection testing

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Track (Active)

In parallel with infrastructure development, I’ve completed structured SOC analyst simulations through LetsDefend and hands-on red/blue team training via TryHackMe. I'm currently deploying Security Onion to emulate real-world alert triage and log correlation. Focus areas include SIEM workflows, incident lifecycle, segmentation hardening, and adversary emulation.
