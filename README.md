# 👋 Hey there, I’m Marc Alvin Vistan Teano

I’m a late-career pivoter and lifelong tech enthusiast currently rebuilding my professional presence in IT and infrastructure. My journey into tech didn’t start in a lab or a textbook—it started in a dark cinema, heart pounding, watching *Hackers (1995)*, *The Matrix (1999)*, *Sneakers (1992)*, *WarGames (1983)*, *Ghost in the Shell (1995)*, and *Johnny Mnemonic (1995)*. Those films sparked something in me—a curiosity about systems, security, and the digital frontier.

That spark became a fire, and eventually, a calling.

## 🧪 Homelab Projects (In Progress)

Each of these projects is designed to simulate real-world tasks and environments I’d encounter in a data center or infrastructure support role:

- **Linux VM Server Build**  
  Deployed Ubuntu Server with a static IP, installed Apache/Nginx, configured firewall rules, and enabled logging.

- **RAID Simulation**  
  Created a multi-disk environment using VirtualBox, built RAID 1 with `mdadm`, simulated disk failure and recovery.

- **Automation Scripting**  
  Bash and PowerShell scripts for user provisioning, log rotation, and scheduled backups.

- **Monitoring & Reporting**  
  Testing tools like `logwatch`, `journalctl`, and lightweight syslog to simulate uptime logs and basic incident triage.

More coming soon. Repo documentation and README files in progress.

## 🚀 The Mission Ahead

I’m not just looking for work—I’m building a return to the field that first inspired me. I bring real-world grit, a team-first mindset, and a passion for problem-solving in high-stakes environments. I’m here to:

- Reinforce reliability and resilience in technical operations  
- Grow in server, systems, and infrastructure support roles  
- Join a team that values precision, patience, and perseverance
